# GET, POST methods with forms and PHP

```
    [
        {
            "id": 111,
            "name": "dsdg",
            "price": 123425,
            "description": "dafdsdfgs",
            "icon": ""
        },
        {
            "id": 333,
            "name": "dsdg",
            "price": 123425,
            "description": "dafdsdfgs",
            "icon": ""
        }
    ]
```

  - GET - is in the address bar 
  - POST - is not in the address bar
  - Both are UNSECURE
  - Get - doesnt need a form
  - Post - needs a form

Thanks to Zsófi for the notes and code.
